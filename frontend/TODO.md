# TODO: Enhance ISL Learning Mode with Interactive Recognition and Dataset Collection

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze existing files and structure
- [x] Create initial plan for game-like learning panels
- [x] Update alphabet-game.html: Expand to full alphabet (A-Z), add interactive feedback (show gesture, user performs, system checks correct/wrong), integrate webcam for real-time recognition, add hover effects and animations
- [x] Create numbers-game.html: Similar to alphabet, for numbers 1-9 (or 1-10 as suggested), with recognition feedback
- [x] Update learn.html: Enable Numbers card, add link to numbers-game.html, enhance hovers
- [x] Update static/css/style-game.css: Add new animations (e.g., success/failure feedback, glows, fades)
- [x] Add continuous practice mode for better user experience (auto-check without clicking)
- [x] Add random quiz mode after mastering all levels (no gesture image shown, test user)
- [x] Add success animations for completing levels/quiz
- [x] Enhance hover effects further

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Integrate recognition: Use app.js or add JS to learning pages for webcam feed and gesture checking (simulate or real if model available)
- [ ] Add dataset collection suggestion: New section/page for collecting 1000+ images per gesture via main recognition page
- [x] Test locally: Run the site and verify interactions, images, hovers, and basic recognition feedback
- [ ] Final verification: Use browser to navigate and check full functionality
- [ ] Incorporate user feedback: Make recognition interactive (user shows hand, system tells if correct/wrong), work for all gestures, suggest dataset collection for 1000+ photos per gesture
